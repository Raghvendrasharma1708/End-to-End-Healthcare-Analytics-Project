## 📌 Project Overview
[cite_start]The objective of this end-to-end healthcare analytics project is to predict **30-day hospital readmissions** for diabetes patients[cite: 1, 22]. [cite_start]By identifying high-risk patients, healthcare providers can proactively intervene to **reduce costs** and **improve patient outcomes**[cite: 23].

> [cite_start]**Dataset:** Diabetes 130-US Hospitals (1999-2008) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository[cite: 25].
